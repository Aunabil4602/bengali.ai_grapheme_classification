This is a project on Bengali Grapheme Classification that was going on Kaggle.

The model is a multioutput CNN using keras, where each output model is similar to Lenet-5 architecture. At first, the image sets was extracted from parquet files to numpy array and size of of each image was reduced to 64x80. Then the model is trained on Google Colab.
